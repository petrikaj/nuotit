## App Descriptions

### One-Liner
Nuotit is the podcast player that shapes your sound — professional audio processing, on-device AI, and smart library management for iOS and iPadOS.

### Short (50 words)
Nuotit is a professional-grade podcast player for iOS and iPadOS that puts studio-level audio control in the listener's hands. Fix poor audio with a 9-band EQ, dynamics engine, and AI voice isolation. Generate transcripts on-device, create shareable clips with dynamic captions, and manage your library with smart playlists — all with total privacy.

### Medium (100 words)
Nuotit transforms how you listen to podcasts. It features a full professional audio toolkit — a 9-band parametric equalizer, dynamics processing (compressor, limiter, expander), AI-powered voice isolation, and real-time spectrum analysis — giving listeners the power to fix muffled voices, tame inconsistent volumes, and eliminate distracting background noise.

Beyond audio, Nuotit offers on-device transcript generation, clip export with dynamic burned-in captions for social media, chapter navigation, and an intelligent library system with smart playlists and auto-downloads. Everything is processed on-device with zero tracking. Built by a European indie developer, Nuotit is designed for the active listener who knows the details matter.
