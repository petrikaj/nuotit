# Nuotit vs. Apple Podcasts — Detailed Comparison

> Apple Podcasts comes pre-installed on every iPhone. But is the default really good enough for how you listen?

## Overview

| | Nuotit | Apple Podcasts |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | Free with Premium | Free |
| **Platform** | iOS, iPadOS | iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS |
| **Developer** | single indie dev, European | Apple |

## Audio Processing

This is where Nuotit fundamentally differs from Apple Podcasts — and every other podcast app.

| Feature | Nuotit | Apple Podcasts |
|---------|:------:|:--------------:|
| 9-Band Parametric Equalizer | ✅ | ❌ |
| Compressor | ✅ | ❌ |
| Peak Limiter | ✅ | ❌ |
| Expander | ✅ | ❌ |
| Voice Isolation | ✅ AI-powered | ❌ |
| Enhance Dialogue | ❌ | ✅ iOS 26+ (ML-based) |
| AI Audio Assist | ✅ | ❌ |
| Audio Profiles | ✅ Per show/environment | ❌ |
| Real-Time Spectrum Analyzer | ✅ | ❌ |
| LUFS / True Peak Metering | ✅ | ❌ |
| Volume Boost | ✅ With headroom monitoring | ❌ |

**Apple Podcasts** in iOS 26 features "Enhance Dialogue," a native machine-learning tool that dynamically isolates human speech and suppresses background noise. While Apple utilizes hardware-level Neural Engine processing for an invisible one-tap solution, **Nuotit** offers the full manual toolkit — EQ, dynamics, voice isolation, spectrum analyzer, and AI assistance — giving you precise, configurable control that Enhance Dialogue cannot match.

## Transcripts

|---------|:------:|:--------------:|
| Feed-Provided Transcripts | ✅ | ✅ |
| Transcript Generation | ✅ On-device (iPhone 15 Pro+) | ✅ Server-side |
| Transcript Search | ✅ | ✅ |
| Copy Text | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited |

Nuotit generates transcripts entirely on-device with full privacy. Apple Podcasts uses server-side processing, meaning audio is sent to Apple's servers.

Nuotit's clip export turns any audio segment into a shareable video with animated waveforms, dynamic captions, and custom backgrounds — all on-device. Apple Podcasts supports native video podcast playback but has no clip creation tools.
