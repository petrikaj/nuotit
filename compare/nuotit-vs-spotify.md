## Overview

|---|---|---|
| **Price** | Free with Premium | Free with Premium |

## Audio Processing

| Feature | Nuotit | Spotify |
|---------|:------:|:------:|
| 9-Band Parametric EQ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Compressor / Limiter / Expander | ✅ | ❌ |
| Voice Isolation | ✅ AI-powered | ❌ |
| AI Audio Assist | ✅ | ❌ |
| Audio Profiles | ✅ Per show/environment | ❌ |
| Spectrum Analyzer | ✅ | ❌ |
| LUFS Metering | ✅ | ❌ |
| Basic EQ (music + podcasts) | N/A | ✅ Preset only |

Spotify's native equalizer explicitly features an "Also apply to podcasts" toggle, allowing listeners to manipulate frequency bands specifically for spoken-word content. However, it offers no parametric control, no dynamics processing, no voice isolation, and no AI assistance — it's a listening convenience tool rather than a professional audio toolkit. Nuotit turns every podcast into a precisely tailored listening experience.
